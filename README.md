# Automated Financial Statement Analyzer (Ready-to-run)

Built a Python tool that extracts financial line items from text/PDF statements.

Files included:
- analyzer.py : main program (double-click or run with Python)
- complex_statement.txt : realistic sample input (in thousands)
- statement.txt : very simple sample input

Overview:
Extracts core financial items (Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Liabilities, Cash) from text/PDF financial statements, computes ratios (profit margin, debt-to-equity, ROE, ROA), and outputs JSON/CSV/HTML reports.
